# GuiKeyStandalone - Package Generator Guide (P2P Mode)

## 1. Introduction

The "Remote Activity Monitor - Package Generator (P2P Mode)" is a tool designed to create self-contained deployment packages for a peer-to-peer (P2P) based activity monitoring system. It generates:

1.  **`LocalLogServer_Package`**: This package is for the operator (you). It contains the server application that will receive and store activity logs from clients.
2.  **`ActivityMonitorClient_Package`**: This package is for distribution to the target machines you wish to monitor. It contains the client application that captures activity and sends it to your server.

The generator embeds the necessary client and server executable templates and server web assets. When you click "Generate Deployment Packages," it customizes these with unique cryptographic keys and configurations based on your input.

## 2. Using the Generator GUI

The GUI is divided into several sections:

### 2.1. Core Deployment Configuration (Crucial First Steps)

*   **Step 1: Configure Bootstrap Multiaddresses (for Client Package)**
    *   **Purpose:** These are addresses the client will use to find the server or join the P2P network.
    *   **Format:** Comma-separated libp2p multiaddresses.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Public libp2p DHT nodes (helps general discovery): `/dnsaddr/bootstrap.libp2p.io/p2p/QmNnooDu7bfjPFoTZYxMNLWUQJyrVwtbZg5gBMjTezGAJN`
        *   Your server's direct address (if known, static, and publicly reachable): `/ip4/YOUR_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP/tcp/YOUR_SERVER_P2P_PORT/p2p/YOUR_SERVER_PEER_ID` (The server's P2P port and PeerID are determined when the server runs).
        *   A relay server's address: `/ip4/RELAY_IP/tcp/RELAY_PORT/p2p/RELAY_PEER_ID`
    *   **Recommendation:** Include a mix of public bootstrap nodes and, if possible, your server's expected multiaddress once you know it (you might generate once, run the server to find its address, then re-generate client packages with that specific address included in bootstrap list for more direct connection).

*   **Step 2: Select Output Directory**
    *   **Purpose:** Choose a folder where the `ActivityMonitorClient_Package` and `LocalLogServer_Package` directories will be saved.
    *   Click "ðŸ“‚ Select" to browse for a directory.

### 2.2. Local Log Server Package Configuration (Operator's Machine)

These settings configure how the server application (`LocalLogServer_Package/local_log_server.exe`) will run on *your* machine.

*   **Server P2P Listen Multiaddress:**
    *   The libp2p address the server will attempt to listen on for P2P connections from clients.
    *   Examples:
        *   `/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/0`: Listens on all IPv4 interfaces, OS chooses a TCP port.
        *   `/ip4/0.0.0.0/udp/0/quic-v1`: Listens on all IPv4 interfaces for QUIC, OS chooses a UDP port.
    *   The server will log its *actual* listening multiaddress(es) and its PeerID on startup. You'll need this PeerID for client configurations if you didn't pre-generate it or if it changes.
*   **Server Web UI Listen Address:**
    *   The IP address and port for the server's local web interface (for viewing logs).
    *   Format: `IP:PORT`
    *   Examples: `127.0.0.1:8090` (only accessible from your machine), `0.0.0.0:8090` (accessible on all network interfaces on your machine, e.g., if you access it from another device on your LAN).
*   **Server Database File Name:**
    *   Name of the SQLite file where logs will be stored (e.g., `activity_logs.sqlite`). It will be created in the `LocalLogServer_Package` directory.
*   **Server Log Retention (days):**
    *   How long the server keeps logs in its database. `0` means logs are kept indefinitely.

### 2.3. Generated Server Libp2p Peer ID (for client package)

*   This field will display:
    *   `N/A (will be generated)`: Before you click "Generate".
    *   `Generating...`: During the generation process.
    *   The actual **Server Peer ID**: After successful generation.
*   **Importance:** The client package is configured to connect *specifically* to this Server Peer ID.

### 2.4. Activity Monitor Client Package Configuration (Remote Machines)

These settings apply to the client applications (`ActivityMonitorClient_Package/activity_monitor_client_core.exe`) that will be deployed on remote machines.

*   **Client Autorun Name:** The name used for the Windows Registry entry if autostart is enabled by the client.
*   **Client Cache Retention (days):** How long the client will keep unsent logs locally if it cannot reach the server. `0` for indefinite.
*   **Client Sync Interval (sec):** How often the client attempts to send its collected logs to the server.
*   **Periodic Session Flush (sec):** Interval to finalize and store the current application's activity session even if the user hasn't switched applications. `0` to disable.
*   **Max Client Log File Size (MB):** Maximum size for the client's local log cache file (`activity_data.jsonl`). `0` for no limit (can consume disk space if server is unreachable for long).
*   **Client Internal Log Level:** Verbosity of the client's own diagnostic logs (for troubleshooting client issues). Options: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR.

### 2.5. Generate Deployment Packages Button

*   Once all configurations are set, click this button.
*   The GUI will generate unique encryption keys, a server identity, and a client ID.
*   It will then create the `LocalLogServer_Package` and `ActivityMonitorClient_Package` in your selected Output Directory.
*   A `README_IMPORTANT_INSTRUCTIONS.txt` file will also be created in the Output Directory with deployment details.

### 2.6. Status Area

*   Displays messages about the generation process, success, or any errors.
*   After generation, it will show snippets of the generated Client ID and AES Key, and the full Server Peer ID.

## 3. Deployment

Refer to the `README_IMPORTANT_INSTRUCTIONS.txt` file generated in your Output Directory for detailed steps on:
*   Running the Local Log Server.
*   Distributing and running the Activity Monitor Client.
*   Important security considerations.

## 4. P2P Key Concepts

*   **Peer ID:** A unique cryptographic identifier for each P2P node (client or server).
*   **Multiaddress:** A self-describing network address format used by libp2p (e.g., `/ip4/192.168.1.5/tcp/12345/p2p/QmPeerIdHash`).
*   **Bootstrap Nodes:** Initial peers a node connects to for joining the P2P network and discovering other peers.
*   **NAT Traversal:** P2P systems often need to work across Network Address Translators (NATs). Your setup uses features like DCUtR and AutoNAT to help with this. Relays can also be used.

## 5. Security

*   The **App-Level Encryption Key** is used to encrypt log data between clients and the server. It's generated uniquely for each set of packages.
*   The **Server Libp2p Identity Seed** is used to generate the server's unique P2P identity.
*   **Keep these keys and seeds secure.** The generated `client_settings.toml` (in the client package) and `local_server_config.toml` (in the server package) contain these sensitive values.
*   Ensure you have consent and adhere to relevant laws and ethics when deploying the monitoring client.
